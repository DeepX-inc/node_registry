# Node Registry

The node_registry package provides the base node classes and utils to eliminate boilerplates when creating ROS nodes. For example when using the simulator all the use_sim_time parameter of all nodes in the system should be set to True. Using the registry base class, such functionalities can easily be accomplished. This is applicable for both C++/Python.
